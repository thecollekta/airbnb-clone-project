## Feature Breakdown

### 1. API Documentation

**Implementation**:

- OpenAPI standard for REST endpoints
- Django REST Framework's browseable API
- GraphQL schema
**Purposes**:
Provides clear, interactive documentation for both REST and GraphQL APIs, enabling
seamless frontend-backend integration and third-party developer onboarding. Ensures API
consistency and discoverability throughout the project lifecycle.

### 2. User Authentication

**Components**:

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing
- Role-based access control
**Functionality**:
Securely manage user registration, login, and profile management. Supports both guest
and host roles with appropriate permissions, protecting sensitive operations like
property modifications and payment processing.

### 3. Property Management

**Capabilities**:

- CRUD operations for property listings
- Geolocation search (PostGIS)
- Availability calendar integration
**Value**:
Enables hosts to create and manage listings with rich metadata (amenities, photos,
pricing rules). Provides guests with powerful search filtering, and discovery tools
for finding accommodations.

### 4. Booking System

**Workflow**:  

- Date conflict validation  
- Dynamic pricing calculation  
- Booking status lifecycle  
**Process**:  
Manages reservation creation, modification, and cancellation. Integrates with property calendars to prevent double-booking and calculates totals based on seasonal pricing, cleaning fees, and taxes.

### 5. Payment Processing

**Integration**:  

- Stripe/PayPal gateway support  
- PCI-compliant transaction handling  
- Receipt generation  
**Security**:  
Processes payments asynchronously via Celery, storing only minimal transaction metadata. Implements idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges and provides booking-specific payment histories.

### 6. Review System

**Features**:  

- Rating system (1-5 stars)  
- Verified guest reviews  
- Host response functionality  
**Trust Building**:  
Allows guests to leave reviews only for completed stays, ensuring authentic feedback.
Hosts can respond to reviews, creating accountability and transparency in the community.

### 7. Database Optimizations

**Techniques**:  

- PostgreSQL query indexing  
- Redis caching layer  
- Connection pooling  
**Performance**:  
Ensures sub-second response times for frequent queries (property searches, availability checks). Reduces database load through intelligent caching and optimized index strategies.
